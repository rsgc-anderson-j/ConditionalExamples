 # Introduction
 Programmers need to tell the computer how to *respond to events*.
 
 Events to respond to might include, but are not limited to:
 
 * input from users
 * the result of a random number being generated

 This playground will explain how to use *conditional statements* to selectively (sometimes) run one block of code, and at other times, run another block of code.
 
 Most of the pages in this review package present visual output in the Assistant Editor.
 
 If you do not see any output, remember to turn on the Assistant Editor, and then click the menu to switch to the Timeline:
